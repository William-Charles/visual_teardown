1. The target user of this site is people who want to be informed and are between 25 and 60
2. The sites critical goal is to consume content
3. The visual hierarchy does lend itself to the consumption of content

5. The font families do a great job of creating hierarchy and drawing eyes to headlines and keeping bodies highly readable.
6. The line spacing feels natural and comfortable font color and weight help reduce eye strain it is a very text heavy site and these choices help produce a great experience
7. The video is on autoplay which ended up making a me a bit nauseous if I spent much time on the front page. There is a ton of stuff going on on the front page I would prefer to have a simpler less cluttered main page with more effective and pronounced navigation
